# Project Overview
The spotted lanternfly is an invasive planthopper that recently arrived in North America. This data visualization project contains two plots that illustrate its rapid spread. The first plot is a map that shows change of range over time. The second is a filled area plot that offers specific observation numbers for each US state affected.

# Installation Instructions
This project's visualizations are located in **plots.ipynb**, which should render directly in Github's browser. If you'd prefer to view the plots offline, you will need to install **Python** and an IDE that supports Jupyter Notebooks (e.g. **VSCode**).

This project uses the **plotly.express** and **pandas** libraries.

# Offline Usage Guide
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate into the folder structure.
3. Open **plots.ipynb**.
4. Execute each cell in order to view the visualizations.
